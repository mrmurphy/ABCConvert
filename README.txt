#Note
This conversion code was written to work with the assets of one specific film. 

This repository is not intended to be a plug-and-play solution for any pipeline. 

But I hope that it gives you some good ideas!

This is a web program for automatic conversion of geometry in a Maya scene to an geometry from an Alembic cache.


#Dependencies:
Maya 2012 with Alembic plugin built. 
Also, requires that mayapy be in the path to run.

#TODO:
Refactor conversion code to run faster.
Change shot list to show most current at top.
Allow scrolling in shot data window.
Don't hard-code the directory to mayapy. Make it more robust.
