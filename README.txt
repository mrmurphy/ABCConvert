This is a web program for automatic conversion of geometry in a Maya scene to an geometry from an Alembic cache.


Dependencies:
Maya 2012 with Alembic plugin built. 
Also, requires that mayapy be in the path to run.

TODO:
Refactor conversion code to run faster.
Change shot list to show most current at top.
Allow scrolling in shot data window.
Don't hard-code the directory to mayapy. Make it more robust.
